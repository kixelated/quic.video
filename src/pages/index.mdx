**Media over QUIC** is a live media protocol powered by [QUIC](https://quicwg.org/):
a super-charged TCP/UDP replacement that powers [HTTP/3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3).
It's being developed by the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/)\* and your _favorite_ big tech companies such as Google, Meta, Cisco, Akamai, Cloudflare, etc.

That's right, *soon* you will never have to deal with WebRTC again.
Unless masochism is your thing.

\***NOTE**: This website uses a [fork](/blog/transfork) of the IETF draft called [moq-lite](https://kixelated.github.io/moq-drafts/draft-lcurley-moq-lite.html) and a media layer called [hang](https://kixelated.github.io/moq-drafts/draft-lcurley-moq-hang.html).
The principles behind MoQ are fantastic, but standards are **SLOW**.
My goal is to build something simple that you can use *now*, even if it's not a standard *yet*.
