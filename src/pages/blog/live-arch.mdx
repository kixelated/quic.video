# Live Video Architecture: For Scale and Profit?

It's time to get that Staff Engineer promotion.
That's right, we're talking about _distributed systems design_.
We're going to design a live video system one interation at a time with increasing complexity.

Be warned that there is no right answer.
This is not an optimization problem where you can literally count the number of cycles a program takes to execute.
It all boils down to pros and cons and how they align with your specific product.


## Requirements 
But first, a message from our sponsor: __requirements__

We're going to build a real-time media application.
There will be N broadcasters and M viewers in a room, some performing both roles.
Think Discord or Google Meet or Zoom or _your least favorite meeting app_ (there's a lot of them).

Considerations to be had:
- Some users will have poor networks.
- Some users will want higher quality/latency (ex. screen share) 
- Some users might be geo-dispersed. ex. some might live in Europe while some live in Freedom.
- Some customers might be willing to pay for better connectivity/quality.

Got that?
Basically just make a conferencing application.

## Design 0: Peer to Peer 
We start with somehow both the least and most complex design: __peer-to-peer__.

That's right, boot up your favorite game from the 2000s and enter your friend's IP address manually.
We don't need no stinking servers, at least until your "friend" enables `noclip`.

The design is very simple, even if the implementation isn't.
Users connect directly to each other with only routers and switches in the middle.
There should still _some_ central server to exchange user details, like a "lobby" service, because we don't want to enter IPs manually or scan the Internet for friends.
Sorry, we're not going to build "Media over Blockchain".

The very first problem with P2P hits us immediately: how do you connect?
One of the clients needs to have a static IP/port which is unlikely because of these pesky things called __NATs__.

In a client/client protocol, one of the two peers needs to  IP/port.

You see, IPv4 addresses are expensive and somehow the Internet hasn't embraced IPv6 yet.
When a client creates a connection to a server, a NAT basically leases it a temporary IP/port pair until the connection is idle.
A client's public IP address can (and will) change potentially on a per-connection basis.

And these NATs are a headache.
WebRTC uses STUN/ICE (and the help of a middle server) to connect clients in what only can be described as a giant hack: smuggling IP/port pairs between "connections".
However, this doesnt work in all scenarios (symmetric NATs) and some peers have to resort to a TURN, literally proxying UDP/TCP traffic through a middle server.

But NATs are not the deal-breaker.
That award is reserved for _multiple participants_.

You see, if Alice is on a peer-to-peer call with Bob, then Alice needs to send their audio/video to Bob only.
Thats like 3Mb/s at least for good quality video.
But if Candy, Dandy, Eric, Fritz, Geof, Harry, Iguana, Joel, Katrina, Luke, Mochael, Nigel, 🍊, Paul, Q, Raul, Steve, Tavana, Uguana, Video, Windy, Xylan, Yennifer, and Zee all join the call, then now Alice needs to send N copies of their media.
There's no way to share the upload*, and now we need at least 78Mb/s of upload capacity now to make sure everyone gets the video.
Your home Internet might be able to support that, but what about your cell phone?

We need a different architecture.

## Design -1: Multicast
"Well of course, you daft blog author, that's why you use multicast!"

It's true, multicast let's you share uploads. 
Instead of sending N unicast packets, you could send 1 multicast packet.
The participants would all join a multicast group and then the routers will figure it out.

Unfortunately, multicast doesn't actually work in practice.
The main problem is that we're entirely reliant on ISPs to work together and build an optimal fanout architecture, and that's just not happening.
There's limited support for multicast outside of datacenter environments that use the same brand of routers.

So we're using unicast.
But, we're using _the ideas behind multicast_.

**New Requirement:** The broadcaster MUST send only one copy of the media.
Instead of the network layer (L2) performing fanout via multicast, we can fanout at the application layer (L7) instead.
That's ultimately the premise behind CDNs: more expressive routing and caching can be performed at higher layers.
But those are spoilers; keep reading.

## Design 1: Hub and Spoke
Okay so we're going to use servers with public IPs.
We must first ask ourselves: "How do you determine which client connects to which server?"

I've got an answer for you: have everyone connect to the same server.

We're already at the most common conferencing architecture.
Discord uses it as do many conferencing applications.
It's a good deaign when meetings consist of a handful of cost-sensitive users.
I thought distributed systems design was supposed to be hard.

Unfortunately, there are two problems with our simple approach:
1. The maximum channel size is limited by the server size.
2. Users far away from the server will have a degraded experience.

When you hear the phrase "WebRTC doesn't scale", this is the architecture being referenced.
A single host has limits in terms of throughput and quality.
If we want to have thousands of people in the same room our only option is to scale vertically.
You can throw larger CPUs and NICs at the problem but eventually you hit a limit.
Other designs can scale horizontally so this isn't a fundamental problem with WebRTC.

And _who_ decides which server to use?
Ideally, the server is the closest on average to all users, but what if users trickle in one at a time?
There's no right answer, only convoluted business logic, but usually it's based on the first user to connect (aka the "host").

**Fun tip**: Next time you have a meeting, make sure the solo Euro member doesn't create the meeting.
Let them suffer alone with poor video quality and free healthcare.

## Design 2: Edge Nodes
So you're serious about improving the user experience and have additional cash to throw around?
Good?

There is an unspoken rule of the internet: it sucks.
The "public" internet consists of interconnected ISPs and transit providers that want to pay as little as possible while keeping customers happy enough.
You might have a fiber internet connection to your ISP's servers, but obviously they're not going to give you a dedicated fiber connection to everywhere in the world.
You're going to get a dedicated connection to the nearest speed test website and that's it.

The internet is the world's largest sharing experiment.
But to get the most reliable experience, we need to explicitly not share.
We want our media packets to spend as little time as possible on the public **inter**net and as much time on our private **intra**net.

That's right, it's time to copy a HTTP CDN and put edge servers next to each user.
Queue the map with all of the datacenters around the world.

<globe of dots>

That's the one, good stuff.

So we provision servers around the world and users will connect to the closest one.
This minimizes the amount of time our user's packets spend mingling with the commoners.
We're now a toddler who refuses to share with anyone else and can better control the quality/cost once the packets are in our network.

But how does a user know which server is the closest?
There's a few options:

1. Ping them all, use the min.
2. Use GeoDNS
3. Use anycast.

I'm a big anycast 🪭 as are most CDNs.
Basically, all of our servers advertise the same IP address and BGP figures out which one is closest.
This gives ISPs greater control on how traffic should be routed, potentially over paths with higher RTTs but lower congestion.

But I'm going to stop blabbing about anycast; we've got _distributed systems_ to design.

Note that we still have a central server that "owns" the meeting room.
This is commonly called the "origin" and each edge node needs to know it's address to proxy media.
Store this in a database or something.


## Design 3: Deduplication

So the previous design has users connect to the closest server, but how do the servers 

But critically, It also gives us the ability to **deduplicate**, serving the same content to multiple users kinda like multicast.
That's why Google even has a CDN edge on a cruise ship.

The other benefit of point-to-point is more subtle: it prevents __tromboning__.
For example, let's say someone from Boston is trying to call someone from the UK a ~~lolly gagger~~ (TODO make sure that properly censors the bad word).

- If we're using a single SFU in us-west, then the traffic first heads west and then back east.
- If we're using multiple SFUs, then the traffic more closely follows the shortest path.

This tromboning is rare in practice as most traffic is regional, but shush I'm trying to over-engineer the system.
We don't want to send traffic back and forth for no reason because it increases latency and reduces capacity.

So yeah, we have every user connect to the closet server via anycast or geo-DNS.
There's some database or gossip protocol used to discover the "origin" server for each user.
When the server needs to route traffic to a user, it routes it to the origin instead.

But the end result looks like a tangled mess.
Or because it 'twis the season, the end result looks more like my 🎄 lights after they magically knotted themselves in the attic (a miracle).
This is no good, because if every edge can connect to any other edge, there can be a lot of duplicated traffic on each link.

## Design 4: A Tree
The internet certainly behaves like a net.
There are many forks and traffic needs to figure out if it should go right or left.

We need to avoid our media going both left and right because it's a waste of our limited network capacity.
But we need to avoid multiple copies too.

For example, let's say an edge in the UK wants to fetch content from an origin in San Francisco
It could fetch from a server in Ireland, then New York, then Chicago, then Utah, then Frisco (nobody calls it that).
If other servers take a similar route, intersecting at some point, then we can combine multiple fetches into one.

It was called a tree at Twitch but it's really more like a river with many tributaries.
Each layer in the tree compounds, reducing hundreds of thousands of edge requests into a handful of origin requests.

But computing this tree is not easy.
Ar Twitch we literally updated it by hand every time there was outage or some sort of change to the network topology.
The process has since been automated as some smart engineers earned their paychecks... only to be scrapped as Twitch was absorbed into the mothership.
But that's a tale for another time...

So yeah, we're doing some application-based routing to try and maximize the cache-hit ratio.
This means less duplicate media flowing over the backbone which means less compute and network capacity needed, which means less money burned on the cloud.
It's just getting increasingly difficult to design as users can join from any edge and leave at any time.

## Design 5: Coalesce
The key word in that last sentence is _any_.
If a user can connect to _any_ edge, then we've already started at a disadvantage.

For example, let's say there's 3 Australian viewers connecting to our service and we have 6 servers in our Sydney datacenter.
If each user connects via anycast or round-robin DNS to the "closest" edge, there's actually some randomization involved to break ties.
Our servers within the Sydney data center have equal latency so our users will be assigned randomly.
This works, but it's not the cheapest.

You see, we want all of those users to connect to the same host so we can serve them from a single cache.
If they're connected to different edges within the same datacenter, then we need to transfer the media between those hosts eating up more compute and network resources.
Every host within the datacenter provides an equal user experience (provided they aren't full) so coalescing users to the same host is pure cost savings.

We need to designate at least one server per datacenter as the "owner" of each meeting.
But there's a gotcha, as now we can cause lopsided load as some meetings are larger than others.
We also need the ability to spill over to additional servers for the largest events as a single server is not enough to serve the Superbowl.

There's a few ways to accomplish this.
One approach is to create a service that assigns each user to a host, but it quickly becomes a monolith as it needs the state of the entire system.
Another approach is to rely on hashing, returning a stateless assignment based on the meeting name with some mechanism to avoid overloading individual hosts.

## Design 6: Optimization 
Now we're in the optimization end-game.

One key flaw in the previous designs is the word "any".
We went from a user connecting to a single host to the user connecting to _any_ host.

If we get academic for just a second, we have a connected graph.
- Every node in the graph is a user or server.
- Every edge is a possible route between servers or a user.

The number of permutations balloons out of control.
Even finding the shortest path starts becoming difficult.
But we're not trying to find the shortest path, we're also trying to find a cheap one.

There's a cost associated with every node and edge.
Some are cheap, some are shit, and some are both although there's not much correlation.
Interconnect is a world of politics filled with price gouging and anti-competitive behavior.
No specifics will be mentioned lest I get sued by a South Korean ISP, or a German one, or really any nationality.

So, we have a classic graph optimization problem where every node/edge has a cost.
But what's really cool about this problem is that _only unique traffic counts_.
The more users we serve from cache, the cheaper a node/link becomes _per user_.

What's the ramifications of this?
Well, maybe serving those 3 users from Australia out of the Syndey data center isn't worth it.
It's expensive to reserve capacity on a wire sitting on the floor of the world's largest ocean.
The Aussies are used to awful Internet, how about we send their traffic over congestion transit links instead?

Maybe if there were 20 users then the cost would average out to something more palatable.
But again, users can join/leave at any time so the "optimal" decision constantly changes.
It's no feasible to constantly _recalculating splines_ so at some point you have to rely on heuristics.

And we have plenty of crude heuristics.
Before beefing up capacity, Twitch would only allow assignments to data centers based on _global_ viewership. 
20 Aussies watching a neighborhood event?
Sorry mate, best we can do is LA.
100 Brazilian viewers and the first Australian viewer shows up?
Welcome to our Sydney data center.

I believe this optimization problem is impossible to solve at scale.
But it's also the secret sauce behind every CDN; as you scale up, more can be cached but where do you draw the line between quality/cost?
